# Missed Signals: Growing Up With Tech, But Not In It

In the mid-1990s, I was under 10 years old and had no idea what having a computer in our home would mean for my future. My uncles worked in the industry, I can't recall to what extent, but it was through them that my parents first entertained the idea of bringing a computer into the house.

My earliest computer memories are vague, but a few vivid snapshots remain: booting up Windows 95, then 98, then XP just to play Pinball, Doom, SiN, Pitfall, and whatever else I had at the time. Like many kids in the late '90s, I’d explore random tools and programs, often breaking the OS in the process. I can’t help but wonder how different my life might’ve been if someone had encouraged me to fix what I broke instead of sheltering me in fear of "causing damage."

I don’t remember the brand of our first computer, but I remember the second: a Compaq desktop with the blue transparent front panel, for my sister when she started high school. We were living in the age of AOL dial-up and MSN Messenger. I still have the clip-on JBL speakers from that setup. And yes, they still bump. The next couple were HP pre-built computers until I was able to start building them myself.

Eventually, we upgraded to DSL around 2005, a long-overdue change. Gone were the days of muffling the screeching dial-up tone with pillows and blankets when I was grounded. I was in high school by then, and all I cared about was making it through the school day so I could go home, play World of Warcraft and Halo 2.

### From Analog to Always-On

Everybody were getting cell phones; Nokia bricks, Motorola flip phones, Razrs, and the SideKick all fighting to be the trendy phone. Around the same time, MySpace and Facebook exploded into our lives. One week no one had heard of them, and the next, fitting in online became just as important as fitting in offline.

Looking back, it’s concerning to think how long it took the world to fully grasp the power, and consequences of social media. At the time, we were just riding the wave. _How are things different now with AI?_

In my junior year of high school, I chose to major in psychology. As a kid of immigrant parents, I believed my perspective on human behavior was unique. I thought I was some kind of intellect, but in truth I was just a pretentious smartass. Years of stagnation and failure later, I realized I wasn’t exceptional. I was too afraid to admit how little I knew.

### A Life Alongside Tech, Not Inside It

The strangest part? I lived through two decades of technological revolution without ever grasping what was happening under the hood. It’s bittersweet to reflect on a time when the seeds of Google Maps, Bluetooth, GitHub, Docker, and React were being planted while I was too distracted or intimidated to get involved.

There were moments I could’ve made the leap. CompTIA certifications, trade schools, online courses were all viable paths I brushed aside. I didn’t lack exposure; I lacked direction. And ultimately, I have no one to blame but myself for getting left behind.

### A Tale of Two Eras: 1995–2025

Between 1995 and 2010, technology transformed daily life and the job market. The internet shifted from dial-up to broadband, businesses moved from isolated office networks to globally connected systems, and software transitioned from boxed products to cloud-delivered services.

Entry-level tech jobs were more plentiful and accessible. Certifications like A+, Network+, and CCNA created clear roadmaps, and while CS degrees held value, they weren’t the only route into tech.

From 2010 to 2025, the industry evolved again. Smartphones, tablets, IoTs became ubiquitous. Cloud computing redefined infrastructure. AI tools now helping us reimagine how we interact with software and data.

Help desk jobs became more complex, focusing less on basic troubleshooting and more on cloud services and cybersecurity. Automation reduced simple tasks, pushing even junior roles to require broader technical depth.

In software development, as the demand exploded so did the bar for entry. Familiarity with languages like JavaScript or Python and frameworks like React or Angular became table stakes. Specializations like machine learning and AI engineering emerged as new “entry points,” but often demanded advanced degrees or rigorous bootcamp training.

While opportunities multiplied, so did the competition. Employers that don't outsource, now seek applicants with tangible skills and real-world experience. Whether through internships, open-source contributions, or solo projects. The barriers are higher. But the doors, though heavier, are still open.

### Moving Forward

I didn’t grow up a developer. I grew up close enough to it to feel its glow, but never brave enough to step into it. That’s what I’m changing now.

The best time to start was always then. The second-best time to start is _now_.
