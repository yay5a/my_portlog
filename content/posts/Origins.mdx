Hello everyone! My name is **Yaysa**.

Today, I want to share a quick story about **persistence**, **learning**, **setbacks**, and the ball‑busting lessons I've learned from life's toughest moments on my ongoing journey.

About three years ago, after a number of unfortunate circumstances compounded to a breaking point, I realized I needed to get my life together. It was a difficult moment, forcing me to face the truth that I hadn't been living up to my potential, regardless of how I felt at the time. Without delving too deeply into my past, I'll share this: For much of my youth, my own limiting beliefs and fears dictated my path. It almost felt too late when I realized how much autonomy I'd relinquished by seeking numbing comfort rather than finding the courage to face my fears.

Needless to say, I persevered through the dark night of the soul and found the will and determination to turn my life around. I pursued a career in programming. It wasn’t long before my curiosity led me to demystify programming languages and see them as multi‑layered Lego blocks, building something tangible and endlessly fascinating. My enthusiasm grew into borderline obsession. After countless hours of chasing bugs through seemingly endless call stacks, downloading and customizing all the IDEs, stepping into the world of software development brought back a childlike wonder long forgotten. The possibilities felt endless.

During that career limbo, I lived on my computer—working through lessons on **freeCodeCamp**, researching, learning, doing everything I could to immerse myself in the world and culture of software development. Undertaking an enormous change independently, with no financial cushion and a family relying on me, brought an overwhelming sense of anxiety and desperation that overshadowed everything I did. I applied to jobs of all kinds just to pay the bills.

Trying to find a way into the industry, I stumbled into the chaotic world of coding bootcamps and enrolled in one partnered with **UT Austin**. I figured an accredited certification and career services would be my ticket into the field.

During my enrollment period, I unexpectedly received a job offer from a local dealership where I'd applied days earlier. Desperate for income, I accepted immediately. In hindsight, juggling a job requiring **50 hours a week**, raising kids, and grinding through the bootcamp became an exhausting, sloppy uphill battle fueled by determination to overcome adversity. Yet, looking back, I don’t recall ever feeling more present in my life. Despite occasional setbacks and blunders, I cherish the time spent with those who inspire me to do better.

There were moments when I fell so far behind on projects that I considered giving up. My chronic insomnia provided caffeine-fueled late‑nights to catch up on assignments and complete projects, eventually allowing me to graduate and earn my certification. The pride and inspiration I felt were fleeting but powerful. For what seemed like the first time, the incessant self-doubt and self‑loathing were drowned out by the happiness of achieving something through my own merit.

Breaking into the tech industry proved more challenging than I anticipated. Despite tireless efforts—applying for countless roles, tailoring resumes, consulting career coaches, creating personal projects, and pursuing additional certifications—no doors opened. All my persistent effort was met with silence for a long time. It was no secret what state the industry was in; **ChatGPT** had just released, layoffs due to COVID fallout were rampant, ancient and dummy job listings, not to mention the higher standard for entry-level positions. The **ones that aren't outsourced overseas**, at least. The industry landscape has really come a long way since 1999. My enthusiasm slowly turned to cynicism, eventually killing any excitement I had for coding.

Meanwhile, the "stable" dealership job offered little growth for my skills. Occasionally, I assisted the warehouse manager and filled various roles around the compound as needed. My efforts were often appreciated but underhandedly exploited. I received small raises from my initial salary, but even combined with my wife's income, it wasn’t enough to provide adequately for my family. Those modest raises never reflected my true worth or the value I brought to the team. I realized I deserved far more than I was earning.

This experience opened my eyes, teaching me powerful lessons about family, self‑worth, resilience, and recognizing when you're being taken advantage of.

Although I’ve taken a hiatus from actively practicing, my passion for building and problem-solving still burns. My experiences have taught me:

-   **Family** is there for me, and I am there for them.
-   **Resilience** matters most when things feel hopeless.
-   **Self‑worth** should never be compromised for comfort or security.
-   **Persistence** doesn’t always mean pushing forward—it also means pausing, reflecting, and recalibrating the approach.

I'm sharing this now as I rekindle my passion for technology, hoping to connect with others and find opportunities aligned with my values. If you’re on a similar journey, know you’re not alone.

Here's to continuing forward, stronger and wiser than ever before.
